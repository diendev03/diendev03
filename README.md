# Have a nice day! My name is Huỳnh Quốc Diện 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a mobile application developer with a strong focus on **Flutter** (cross-platform). I have worked on various projects across different domains such as e-commerce, booking, hotel management, and warehouse systems.  
My experience includes building complex UIs, integrating third-party services like **Firebase**, **AWS S3**, **Pusher**, and optimizing app performance and user experience.

Besides Flutter, I have a background in **Android development using Java**, and I am actively learning and building backend APIs with **Node.js (Express + MySQL)** and web frontends using **ReactJS**.

## 🎯 Career Objective

To apply my current skills and continuously learn new technologies in order to build useful applications that serve real-life and business needs.  
I aim to master both **native and cross-platform mobile development**, while also strengthening my backend development capabilities to create complete app ecosystems.
